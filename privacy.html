        <h2>Data Controller and Processors</h2>
        <p>We are the data controllers as we are collecting and using your Personal Data. We use trusted third parties as our data processors for technical and organizational purposes, including payments for services. We use reasonable efforts to make sure our data processors are GDPR- compliant.</p>  
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect certain personal information from you so that we can provide you with a positive experience when utilizing our Website or content. The legal basis for our actions is your explicit consent, contractual obligation or our legitimate interest, namely, the proper administration of our website and business. Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for collecting your Personal Data, we will ask you to opt-in and agree to collection of such information. We may collect your name and an e-mail address so we can deliver our e-mails to you (i.e., responses to inquiries in contact forms, scheduling consulting sessions and summaries of your coaching sessions) – you would be affirmatively consenting to this by providing this to us in our contact forms. Billing information, including name, address and credit card information is provided by you directly to PayPal so that we can process payment to deliver our products or services to you under our contractual obligation.</p>

If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Data, you may not be able to participate in certain aspects of our Website or content.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Do With Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Contacting You</h3>
